I don't know how to Github

I still don't know how to Github, but I guess I'm learning it now.

This text was added in the `readme-edits` branch. Can I make a pull request to add it?

Yes, but I was told by [@EPICHICKENSOUP](https://github.com/epichickensoup/) in a [review](https://github.com/epichickensoup/hello-world2/pull/3#pullrequestreview-602484003) to add a thing
